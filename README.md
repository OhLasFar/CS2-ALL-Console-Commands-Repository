# CS2 ALL Console Commands Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive list of all Counter-Strike 2 console commands and variables, categorized for ease of use and reference. The commands are sourced from [Valve Software's developer page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_Counter-Strike_2_console_commands_and_variables).

## Command Categories Explanation
In Counter-Strike 2, console commands are categorized to control different aspects of the game. Here's a summary of what each category signifies:
- **`sv` (Server Commands)**: These commands are related to server settings and control aspects that affect the overall game environment.
- **`cl` (Client Commands)**: Client commands focus on individual player settings, such as personal interface and graphics settings.
- **`rep` (Replication Commands)**: These commands deal with the replication of data or actions across the network in multiplayer settings.
- **`nf` (Network Commands)**: Network commands relate to networking settings, including packet handling and connection parameters.
- **`per_user`**: Commands or settings that are specific to individual user preferences or configurations.
- **`release`**: Commands available in the publicly released version of the game, accessible to all players.
- **`cheat`**: Commands that change the game to give players an unfair advantage (like invulnerability or infinite ammo), usually restricted to non-competitive play modes.
- **`server_can_execute`**: Commands that can be executed by the server in a multiplayer environment.
- **`a`**: A general flag used for a variety of purposes, context-specific.
- **`norecord`**: Commands that are not recorded in demo files, relevant for real-time gameplay.
- **`clientcmd_can_execute`**: Client-side commands that individual players can control.
- **`user`**: Likely related to commands specific to user preferences or configurations.
- **`disconnected`**: Possibly relates to commands available or relevant when not connected to a server.
